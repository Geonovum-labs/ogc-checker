# Geonovum OGC Checker

This repository contains a checker (validation & linting) for [OGC API Standards](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/) and [OGC Features and Geometries JSON (JSON-FG): Part 1 Core](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-045.html).

## JSON-FG

The validation rules are based on JSON-FG requirements classes [Core](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-045.html#rc_core), [3D](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-045.html#rc_3d) and [Features types and Schemas](https://docs.ogc.org/DRAFTS/21-045.html#rc_types-schemas). In addition, the checker does some consistency checks that are useful but not based on explicit requirements.

The following table gives an overview of supported JSON-FG requirements. The codes in the Rules column are the
requirement names as listed in the OGC standard document. The table mentions separate sub requirements (e.g. "A", "B") only when some are and some are not supported.

## Development

Prepare your local environment:

- Install project dependencies: `npm install`
- Install VSCode extensions: Prettier, ESLint, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
